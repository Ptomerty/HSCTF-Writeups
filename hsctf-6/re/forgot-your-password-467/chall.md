Help! I got this new lock for Christmas, but I've forgotten the first two values. I know the last value is `hsctfissocoolwow`. I also managed to grab a copy of their secret key generator. Can you help me out?

Note: submit the first two values separated by a space in hex format.

Note: only upload generator.py
